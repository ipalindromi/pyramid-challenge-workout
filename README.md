# The Pyramid Challenge
Just a little challenge I came up with for myself. This is a workout that _will_ build strength and stamina.
## How To Use
You can clone this repository and run `yarn start` and the program will start up at
`http://localhost:3000`.

You can also use a live version here: https://ipalindromi.github.io/pyramid-challenge/

## The Goal
This workout it is a fun way of building strength amd muscle endurance simultaneously. It can get very, very hard.

I don't expect many people to want to serve this app themselves, so I'll keep a live version going for myself and
anyone else interested.

There are many quality of life features I hope to add soon, the most important of which is a built-in timer.

## The Stack
This app is build with:
- React
- Redux
- react-router
- plate-calculator ([A library of mine](https://github.com/ipalindromi/plate-calculator))

## TODO
- Exercise timers, so you can keep track of how long each set took, and track how long the challenge took to complete.
- Localized persistence, so your settings don't disappear on reload.
- Add testing for at least the calculations.
- Metric mode
- More exercises
- Dumbbell mode
